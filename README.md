# extendMV2
The extendmanifestv2.sh script ensures that extensions using Manifest V2 in Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers continue to function until June 2025. Google has announced that Manifest V2 extensions will no longer be supported by this date, but this script enables users to extend compatibility with these extensions during the transition period.

Caution: When the policy modifications required to support Manifest V2 are enabled in Chromium browsers, Secure DNS may be automatically disabled.
